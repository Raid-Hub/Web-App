/**
 * This component is responsible for managing the user's session.
 * While the server is rendering the page, it will fetch the user's session from the server.
 * Once the page is rendered on the client, the session will be managed by the `ClientSessionManager`.
 *
 * This means that useSession() will not work on the client until the session is fetched.
 * So any components that rely on useSession() should call getServerSession() first
 *
 * Additionally, some pages are rendered statically, meaning the session will be null. We can
 * force the session to be fetched client-side by setting the session to undefined, basically tricking
 * the provider into thinking the session was not fetched on the server. We use the `isStatic` prop to
 * determine this based on the existence of the user agent.
